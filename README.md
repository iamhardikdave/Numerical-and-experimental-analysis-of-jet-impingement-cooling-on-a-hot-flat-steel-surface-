B.Tech Project
– Conducted numerical simulations using the VOF with the realizable k − ε turbulence model in ANSYS Fluent.
– Plot critical heat flux versus time at different radial locations on a 10mm thick steel plate for varying jet velocities.
– Compared the cooling performance of RO water vs. hard water (TDS 700) jets with the help of rewetting velocity.
